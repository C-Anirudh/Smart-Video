00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.469
 Cells are the smallest living units of an organism. 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.439
 All cells have 3 things in common 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:18.559
 No matter what type of cells they are 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.000
 All cells have a cell membrane which separates the inside of the cell from the outside environment. 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.000
 Cytoplasm, which is a fluid (fluid) like gelatin (pudding) 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.600
 and DNA which is the genetic material of the cell. 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.780
 We generally have two categories of cells. 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.000
 The first category are Eukaryotic cells. 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.790
 They have organelles 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.990
 That includes the nucleus and other special parts. 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.720
 Eukaryotic cells are the most advanced and complex cells. 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.400
 like those found in plants and animals 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.940
 The second category are prokaryotic cells. 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.780
 They have no membrane-bound nucleus or organelle. 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.560
 They have genetic material, but it is not enclosed in the nucleus. 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.080
 Prokaryotic cells are always uniform. 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.530
 or unicellular organisms (uni-one, cell-cell), such as bacteria. 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.160
 So what are organelles? 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.000
 The word organel means "small organ" 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.700
 Organelles are specialized parts of the cell that have specific jobs to do. 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.960
 Let’s start with the nucleus, the cell’s control center. 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.570
 The nucleus contains DNA or genetic material. 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.060
 DNA dictates (guides) the cell what needs to be done 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.160
 and how it will do it (process-work). 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.939
 Chromatin is the interconnected and widespread form of DNA found inside the nuclear membrane. 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.339
 When a cell is ready to divide 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.500
 DNA condenses (accumulates) into structures known as chromosomes. 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.100
 The nucleus also contains a nucleolus 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.459
 which is a structure in which ribosomes are formed. 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.140
 Once the ribosomes are removed from the nucleus 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.880
 they will have as their main job -synthesis- 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.200
 or protein creation. 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.910
 Outside the nucleus, ribosomes and the rest of the organelles 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.760
 swim around in cytoplasm, which is gelatinous substance. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.700
 Ribosomes can move freely within the cytoplasm 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.080
 or cling to the endoplasmic reticulum (mesh), abbreviated as ER. 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.680
 There are two types of ERs: 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.150
 Rough ER (granular) which has ribosomes attached to it 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.080
 and smooth (agranular) ER that has no self-adhesive ribosomes. 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.540
 Endoplasmic reticulum 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.330
 is a membrane-enclosed path (road) that transports materials 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.540
 such as ribosome-synthesized proteins. 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.100
 Proteins and other materials 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.850
 emerge from the endoplasmic reticulum 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.609
 in small bladders (air or fluid) 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.810
 hence the Golgi apparatus, which is often referred to as the Golgi body 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.470
 accepts them. 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.010
 During protein excretion through the golgi apparatus they are modified 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.209
 in forms (types) which the cell can use. 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.230
 The body of the globe does this by splitting the proteins into usable forms. 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.549
 or by adding other materials to them. 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:44.750
 such as lipids 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.140
 or carbohydrates. 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.300
 Vacuoles are bags-shaped structures that store various materials. 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.149
 Here, in this plant cell, the central vacuole stores water. 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.140
 If we go back to animal cells 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.179
 you will see an organelle called a lysosome. 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.399
 Lysosomes are waste collectors. 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.360
 which insert used or damaged parts of the cell. 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.440
 They are filled with enzymes which process (break down) these fungal wastes. 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.900
 Mitochondria are an organelle that serves as an energy source for both types: 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.710
 plant and animal cells 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.590
 Throughout a process known as Cellular Breathing 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.619
 mitochondria form ATP molecules 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.940
 which supply energy to all cellular processes. 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.900
 Cells that need more energy 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.739
 have more mitochondria. 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.599
 Meanwhile the cell retains its shape 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.400
 with the help of a cytoskeleton (cell skeleton) 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.700
 The skeleton contains microfilaments in the form of fibers 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.460
 which are made up of proteins 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.440
 and microtubules that are thin, hollow tubes. 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.420
 Some organisms 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.460
 such as photoautotrophic plants 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.940
 which means they receive sunlight for energy 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.340
 have cells that contain an organelle called a coloroplast 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.560
 Chloroplast is where photosynthesis occurs 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.810
 It is green because it contains a green pigment called 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.260
 Chlorophyll. 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.830
 Plant cells also have a cell wall outside the cell membrane 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.039
 which gives shape, supports and protects the plant cell. 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.020
 Animal cells never have a cell wall 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.800
 There are different types of structures that only a few cells have 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.000
 Here are just a few of them. 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.000
 In humans, for example, the respiratory tract is lined with cells that contain cilia. 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.440
 These are microscopic designs in the form of hair 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.500
 which move in the form of waves. 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:08.140
 This ability enables the capture of airborne worms and throws them out through coughing. 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:15.700
 Another unique feature of some cells is the flagellum. 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.049
 Some bacteria have flares. 

00:06:18.049 --> 00:06:23.779
 The flagellum is like a small tail that allows the cell to move or push itself forward. 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.820
 The only human cell that has a flagellum 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.599
 is the sperm cell 

00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:33.469
 As a generalization, remember that: 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:40.479
 Eukaryotic cells are plant and animal cells that have a membrane-bound nucleus and organelle. 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.820
 While prokaryotic cells are single-celled organisms that do not have these. 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.860
 All cells have a cell membrane, cytoplasm, and genetic material. 

00:06:56.799 --> 00:06:59.839
 Although only plant cells have chloroplasts 

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:03.159
 both cells (plant and animal) have mitochondria.
