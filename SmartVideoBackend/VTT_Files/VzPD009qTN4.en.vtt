00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.620
 Germs are everywhere, 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.200
 In your phone, 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.060
 In your water bottle, 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.920
 In your hands before you wash them, 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.160
 In your hands after you washed them off, 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.740
 And they literally cover every place of your body too 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.300
 Microbes are everywhere, and there is nothing we can do about it 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.420
 So, we made a deal millions of years ago, 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.340
 The point is to give them shelter and food 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.500
 In return, they work for us. 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.840
 But the more we know about this partnership, the more it looks like a cold war 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.300
 Within the wombs of our mothers, humans are initially sterile 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.800
 When we are born and pass through the birth canal, 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.120
 Billions of bacteria from our mothers completely cover our bodies. 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.900
 This is an important part of human health. 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.320
 Children born by cesarean section have a higher rate of asthma, 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.920
 Immune diseases and even leukemia. 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.200
 So our bodies do not just accept the invasion of microorganisms. She even welcomes her 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.100
 Over millions of years, we develop together to make the best of our relationship. 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.600
 Breast milk for example, 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.620
 It contains special sugar to nourish and help 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.140
 Some groups of microbes, 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.740
 That works as your company for the other, 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.220
 And it helps to modify the immune system. 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.020
 It takes two years for a healthy community to form microbes 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.120
 Every human being has his own microbiome, made up of bacteria, 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.920
 Viruses, fungi and other creatures. 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.980
 We have three types of guests, on and on in our bodies 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:43.900
 the first: 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.100
 Silent travelers do their jobs, and they are politely ignored. 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.600
 By staying there, they take space and keep violent intruders away. 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.450
 The second: 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.920
 The guests that are harming us, 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.740
 But we learned to live with them, 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.280
 For example, bacteria that literally create acid that melts our teeth, 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.740
 If we do not use the miswak enough. 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.300
 They want to take as much space as they can 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.880
 And we don't want them to do that. 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.880
 However, we cannot get rid of it completely. 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.980
 the third: 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.080
 The friendly fellows, which our bodies want you to be around, 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.220
 Most of them have a community of 380,000 billion bacteria, 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.100
 Up to 5,000 different species may live in our gut. 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.900
 These small intestine organisms help us digest food, 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.700
 And pulling additional calories is one that we cannot digest ourselves. 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.440
 Unfortunately, our intestine is also an ideal point of attack for intruders, 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.540
 That which is guarded by the aggressive army, 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.480
 Our immune system. 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.800
 To survive here, we have a microbiome with us co-evolved 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.180
 To be able to communicate with our body. 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.420
 The most important part of this is to ask the immune system not to kill them. 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.240
 However, they also have a real motivation to keep our gut healthy, 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.340
 Even some of them produce messenger materials, 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.600
 That helps educate the immune system, 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.440
 Others stimulate intestinal cells to regenerate faster. 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.640
 However, over the past few years. 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.880
 Evidence has emerged that the effect of our gut microbiome, 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.880
 It goes much further. 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.780
 It may even occur directly to the brain. 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.240
 I noticed some strange things, 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.540
 90% of Serotonin is our body, 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.960
 An important messenger substance for neurons, 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.900
 It is produced in the gut. 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.540
 Some scientists believe that the microbiome does this, 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.640
 To communicate with the vagus nerve. 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.500
 The information superhighway of our nervous system. 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.260
 Other examples are bacteria that stimulate immune cells in the intestine, 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.280
 So they send a kind of warning signal to the brain. 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.500
 Here, it also activates immune cells that help the brain recover from infections. 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.020
 Since the brain decides what we eat, 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.840
 The microbiome is interested in a healthy brain. 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.460
 A new field of science opened here, 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.140
 And we're just about to understand how these can be 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.760
 The complex systems within our bodies interact. 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.120
 But we're starting to see how much our microbiome has 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.180
 It really affects us and our behavior. 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.440
 Take depression, for example. 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.700
 Healthy rat microbes feed from the courage of depression, 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.260
 I started showing anxiety behavior like, 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.980
 And symptoms that look like depression. 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.360
 And in early 2017, a microbiome study of intelligence linked, 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.500
 By attaching a specific group of bacteria in newborns, 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.180
 With the best motor and language skills. 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.260
 But it may also affect our daily life. 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.740
 Experiments with fruit flies, 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.960
 It showed that microbiome affected what types of food it craved. 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.720
 This may mean your microbes are able to say to your mind, 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.400
 Food that must be obtained. 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.480
 Although, this is not a one-way street 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.200
 Our microbiome seeds come from our mother, 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.280
 But how it changes and changes, is determined by what we eat. 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.280
 The organisms feed our secret on various things, 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.680
 Some like fiber and leafy greens, 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.900
 Others go to sugars and starches, 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.040
 Some love greasy potatoes and butter. 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.820
 We have a bowel like a garden in which we decided constantly, 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.080
 What will grow and bloom. 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.680
 If we eat healthy food, we strain the bacteria that healthy food is like. 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.500
 If we eat a lot of fast food, then we strain the fast-loving food bacteria. 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.340
 Life is hard, so we can get trapped in a vicious circle. 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.120
 You have a stressful time, eat lots of burgers, french fries and pizza. 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.640
 This is great for bacteria for fast food, 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.720
 They multiply, multiply, and take up an area of ​​loving plant bacteria. 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.680
 Worse yet, it sends signals to the brain to continue what it does. 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.800
 This makes you want more fast food than that. 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.920
 Which generates more rapidly food bacteria, 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.640
 That makes you crave fast food, etc. and so on. 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.220
 This kind of self-reinforcement cycle, 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.360
 It can play a huge role in obesity. 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.240
 However, it is important to stress that this process cannot be fought, 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.400
 And the opposite, by eating healthy food and breeding more good bacteria. 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.760
 Beyond overweight, our microbiome has also been linked to the other 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.660
 Serious diseases like autism, 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.880
 Schizophrenia, and cancer. 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.600
 One of the first symptoms of Parkinson's disease is actually gut problems. 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.680
 If your body is overtaken with bacteria that harm you, 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.900
 Often there is only one solution. 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.360
 You bring in an army of good guys. 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.820
 its very easy, 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.100
 You just planted some healthy tube. 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.820
 You can do this by literally transferring a tube, from a healthy person, 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.580
 In your gut. 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.800
 This method is already used to treat diarrhea 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.200
 This is what happens when C. bacteria are difficult, gut microbiome control. 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.320
 But we don't know enough about the complicated interaction at work here yet. 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.520
 For example, transplantation from overweight cured donor donor diarrhea, 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.760
 But obesity contributed to her down the line. 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.940
 This caused some methods and another one tried to study to reverse the effect. 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.060
 Laying a tube of slim people to that obese, 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.440
 It gave them a more varied microbiome, 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.900
 And make it less sensitive to insulin. 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.800
 All of the things that also happen when people lose weight 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.720
 We need to do a lot of scientific research, to really understand this 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.320
 How microbes make us more healthy or sick. 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.120
 However, whether we like it or not. 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.800
 We need our microbes, and we need us too. 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.540
 We will never have our bodies for ourselves. 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.060
 But we included a strong ally, 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.060
 If we can keep peace.
