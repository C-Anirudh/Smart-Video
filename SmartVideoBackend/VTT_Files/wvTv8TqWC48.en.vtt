00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:05.640
 Proteins play innumerable roles throughout the biological world. 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.059
 Some of these proteins transport nutrients throughout the body. 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.360
 And some of them help chemical reactions to occur at a faster rate. 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.049
 Others build the foundation for living things 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.340
 Despite this wide range of functions, all proteins are composed of the same 21 building blocks 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.890
 Lumps, called amino acids. 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.970
 Amino acids are made of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen, and some contain sulfur atoms. 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:35.010
 Selenostestin is the only standard amino acid that contains selenium atom. 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.940
 These atoms form an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a side chain attached to the central 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.320
 Carbon atom. 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:49.879
 The side chain is the only part that varies from amino acids to amino acids 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.789
 Its characteristics. 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.719
 Hydrophobic amino acids have a rich carbon side chains, which do not interact well with water. 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:05.780
 Aqueous or polar amino acids interact well with water. 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:19.390
 Charged amino acids interact with opposing charged amino acids or other molecules. 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.260
 The basic structure of the protein 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.550
 Linear sequence of amino acids as encoded by DNA. 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.810
 The amino acids are bound into the protein peptide bond, which binds the amino group 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.740
 From one amino acid to another carboxyl group. 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.119
 The water molecule is released every time a bond may be. 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.200
 A linked chain of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms make up the protein backbone. 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.600
 These protein chains are often divided into two types of secondary structures: alpha rings, or 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.560
 Beta sheet. 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.680
 The alpha helix is â€‹â€‹stabilized in the right coil by hydrogen bonds between the amine and the carboxyl 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.039
 Groups of proximal amino acids. 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.570
 Beta plates are formed when hydrogen bonds stabilize two or more adjacent branches. 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.750
 The third protein structure is a three-dimensional shape of a protein chain. 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.660
 This shape is determined by the properties of the amino acids that make up the chain. 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.521
 Many proteins form spherical shapes with hydrophobic side chains protected inside, away from 

00:02:27.521 --> 00:02:31.890
 Surrounding waters. 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.250
 Membrane-bound proteins have a hydrophobic residue grouped together on the outside, so that 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.330
 They can interact with the lipid in the membrane. 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:50.150
 Charged amino acids allow proteins to interact with molecules that have complementary charges. 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.510
 The functions of many proteins depend on three-dimensional shapes. 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.591
 For example, hemoglobin forms a pocket of heme nodes, a small molecule with an iron atom 

00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:08.900
 At the center that connects the oxygen. 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.170
 Two or more polypeptide chains can come together to form one functional molecule with several 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.170
 Sub units. 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.310
 The four hemoglobin subunits are cooperating so that the compound can capture more oxygen 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.670
 In the lungs and released in the body. 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.701
 Various visual representations of proteins can give us visual clues about protein 

00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:29.830
 Installation and function. 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.740
 This space-filling graph shows all the atoms that make up this protein. 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.360
 This representation, called a strip or cardboard graph, shows protein regulation 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.540
 The backbone and alpha rings are highlighted. 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:51.230
 This surface representation shows the accessible regions of the water molecules. 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.160
 Most proteins are smaller than the wavelength of light. 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.900
 For example, the hemoglobin molecule is about 6.5 nanometers in size. 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.100
 Hemoglobin is found in a high concentration in red blood cells. 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.100
 Typical red blood cells contain about 280 million hemoglobin molecules. 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.300
 3D shapes of proteins determine their function. 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.350
 Flexible weapons of antibodies protect us from disease through recognition and binding to 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.400
 Pathogens are targeting for destruction by the immune system. 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.400
 The hormone insulin is a small and stable protein that can easily maintain its shape while traveling 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.500
 Through the blood to regulate glucose in the blood level. 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.500
 Alpha amylase is an enzyme that starts digesting from starch in our saliva. 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.900
 The calcium pump is aided by magnesium and ATP supported 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.800
 To transfer calcium ions back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum after each muscle contraction. 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.880
 Ferritin is a spherical protein with channels that allow iron atoms to enter and exit 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.320
 Depending on the needs of the organism. 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.710
 In the form of ferritin within a hollow space with atoms, continued to the ener 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:52.500
 Wall. 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.500
 Ferritin stores iron in a non-toxic form. 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.000
 Collagen forms a strong triple helix that is used throughout the body for structural support 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:24.420
 Collagen molecules can form elongated fibers that combine to form collagen fibers. 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.000
 This type of collagen is found in the skin and tendons. 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.690
