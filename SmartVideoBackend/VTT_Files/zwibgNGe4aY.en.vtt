00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:04.290
 Stated Clearly Advance 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.170
 What is DNA? 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.489
 What is the way it works 

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:12.479
 DNA is also known as deoxyribonucleic acid 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.019
 It is a molecule 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.930
 It is a group of atoms attached to each other 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.289
 In the case of genetic material, these atoms are combined into a form 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.070
 A long spiral staircase 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.039
 Kind of like the one in the picture 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.849
 If you have studied biology or watch the movie "The Guards", you have probably heard 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.170
 DNA functions as the blueprint or recipe for the organism 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.410
 but how? 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.100
 How just a part can work as a blueprint for something useful 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.260
 Wonderful like a tree 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.170
 Dog or dinosaur 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.980
 howling! 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.720
 To answer the question 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.830
 Let's take a quick look at amino acids 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.320
 Amino acids are tiny chemicals in our bodies that are very important 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.840
 It is often referred to as the basic building blocks of life 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.710
 There are about twenty different species, each with its own unique shape 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.640
 The great thing about amino acids is that they can be kind of bound together 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.540
 Lego (a cubes game) and the production of an endless array of larger particles, these particles are called proteins 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.860
 Amino acids make proteins 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.990
 Proteins with other chemicals combine to form the living cell 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.829
 The cell forms the tissue 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.579
 The tissues form the organs 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:22.469
 And the members 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:25.170
 When combined together they work of course 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.210
 You combine to form the organism as you and I 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.210
 These proteins that make up our bodies, keep in mind that there are millions 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.210
 Different types of proteins 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.470
 Each must be perfectly crafted to work 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.350
 Wrongly manufactured, it usually does not work 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.920
 Here comes the role of DNA 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.290
 DNA does a lot of exciting things 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.640
 Some of them are still not fully understood 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.430
 But one of the most important and most understandable functions is telling acid 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.189
 Amino 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.469
 How to line up and shape themselves in ideal shapes 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:01.540
 For protein 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.600
 theoretically 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.810
 If the right protein is built at the right time and place 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.789
 Everything from cell to organ to whole organism 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.389
 He will be fine 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:17.900
 Here is a simplified sample of DNA 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.040
 It shows us that the steps of peace 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.120
 It consists of four different types of chemicals shown in different colors 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.339
 And characters 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:27.839
 If you look at one half of the molecule 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:32.709
 You can read this chemical sequence or the genetic code somewhat from top to bottom 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.129
 Like the book 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:35.740
 One strand of DNA 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.369
 very long 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:39.279
 Millions of characters 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:43.869
 DNA spends most of the time wrapped like pasta inside the nucleus 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:45.879
 DNA spends most of the time wrapped like pasta inside the nucleus 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:51.919
 The amino acids are found outside the nucleus in the so-called cytoplasm 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:55.659
 To help DNA interact with the cytoplasm and convert those amino acids 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.479
 Into proteins 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:02.949
 Special chemicals inside the nucleus copy a portion of the DNA code 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:05.390
 These partial copies are called RNA 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.939
 DNA is very similar to DNA, but it is shorter and shorter of course 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.609
 The other side 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.289
 Their small size and shape allow the RNA to pass through small pores on the surface of the nucleus 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:21.049
 To the cytoplasm to the mouth of another particle called a ribosome 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.039
 Ribosomes are protein building machines 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:27.039
 It reads the code in an RNA molecule three letters at a time 

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:30.489
 It absorbs amino acids from their surroundings and affixes them together in 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.909
 Series according to the genetic code 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.639
 As the chain grows bent, it twists and sticks to itself 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.290
 To form an ideal protein 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.569
 To form an ideal protein 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.600
 All three letters of the RNA code 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.240
 The ribosome directs any of the twenty different amino acids a must 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.219
 Next added 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:55.010
 For example CAA makes ribosomes 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.899
 Catches glutamine amino acid 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:59.200
 As for the AGU, it tells the ribosome to catch the two thieves 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.479
 And so on 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:05.699
 Once the protein is made, it does many different things 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:08.659
 From them it helps to create a new cell 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:13.079
 New cell 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.940
 So for the answer to the original question 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.909
 What is DNA? 

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:21.109
 DNA is a molecular diagram of an organism 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.559
 How it works? 

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:24.570
 DNA makes RNA 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.590
 RNA synthesizes protein 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.660
 And proteins go to make life 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.999
 And proteins go to make life 

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:32.830
 This whole process 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.460
 Although it is complex and sophisticated 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.759
 As charming as it may seem 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:41.139
 Totally based on chemistry 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.520
 Can be studied 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.139
 And understanding it 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.020
 Translation of Aasem allamki
